# line--following-robot_OBR2017
A line following robot for OBR 2017 (Brazilian Robotics Olympiad). The core ideia is to use object oriented programming and the FSM algorithm (Finite State Machine), the language used is C++. :smile:

We won the best programming category, but finish in 5th in the line following and rescue category.
